# Introduction #

WordCram installs like any normal Processing library -- just download, unzip, and copy it into the "libraries" folder.

# Details #

  1. Make sure you have Processing installed and working on your computer -- version 1.0 or greater should be fine.
  1. [Download](http://code.google.com/p/wordcram/downloads/list) and unzip WordCram.
  1. Open your Processing sketchbook folder, where all your sketches are saved.
    * _If you don't know where your Processing sketchbook folder is, open Processing, and in File > Preferences, look for "Sketchbook folder"._
  1. In your Processing sketchbook folder, there should be a folder named libraries.  Copy the WordCram folder into it.
  1. Restart Processing.

WordCram is now installed.

# Running a Sample WordCram #

  1. In Processing, open File > Sketchbook > libraries > WordCram, and run any of the sketches under "tutorial" or "examples".
